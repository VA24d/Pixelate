# Project Brief: LED Grid Game Console

## Overview
Create a Python application simulating a 19×19 RGB LED grid with a game console interface for a competition next week (January 16-17, 2026).

## Core Requirements
1. **19×19 RGB LED Grid Simulator**
   - Configurable LED size, spacing, and gap
   - Toggle between circular (realistic) and square (pixel) LED styles
   - Runtime keyboard adjustments

2. **Boot Screen**
   - 2-3 second animated startup sequence
   - Auto-transitions to game menu

3. **Carousel Menu**
   - 4 game options with pixel-art logos and numbers
   - Left/right navigation
   - Space/enter to select
   - Support both smooth and instant transitions

4. **Games**

   - **Basketball** (fully implemented): 2v2 with smart AI (blocking, passing, shooting)
   - **Snake** (placeholder): Coming soon screen
   - **Tetris** (placeholder): Coming soon screen

## Success Criteria
- Clean, professional LED grid visualization
- Smooth animations and responsive controls
- At least 1 fully playable game (Pong) with polish
- Functional menu system
- Ready for competition demonstration

## Timeline
Competition: Next week (January 16-17, 2026)
Status: Implementation complete, testing/polish phase
