## What's Left to Build 🚧

### Optional Enhancements
- ⏳ Sound effects for Basketball
- ⏳ More sophisticated AI difficulty levels
- ⏳ High score tracking
- ⏳ Implement Snake and/or Tetris (if time permits)

### Testing & Polish
- ⏳ Full playthrough testing of all features
- ⏳ Competition demo practice
- ⏳ Performance validation on target hardware (if different from dev machine)

## Current Status 📊

**Overall: ~95% Complete**
- Core features: 100%
- Pong: 100%
- Basketball: 100%
- Menu/Boot: 100%
- Polish: 90%
- Testing: 70%

**Ready for Competition**: Yes, with recommended testing

## Known Issues 🐛

### Fixed
- ~~Flashing border eating screen space~~ ✅ Removed
- ~~AI paddle not moving in 1P Pong~~ ✅ Fixed (now updates every frame)
- ~~Paddle movement too jerky~~ ✅ Smoothed to 0.8 pixels/frame
- ~~Class definition order bug in placeholder_games.py~~ ✅ Fixed

### Active
- None currently identified

### Deferred
- No automated test coverage (accepted for competition timeline)
- Hard-coded game list (acceptable for 4-game demo)

## Evolution of Decisions 📝

### Visual Design
1. **Started with**: Full flashing border for menu selection
2. **Changed to**: Corner indicators only
3. **Final**: No indicators at all - cleaner look

### Game Selection
1. **Original plan**: Pong, Snake, Tetris, Space Invaders
2. **Final**: Pong, Snake (placeholder), Tetris (placeholder), Basketball (full)
3. **Reason**: Basketball 2v2 AI more impressive than Space Invaders

### AI Implementation
1. **First attempt**: Timed updates with delays (0.15s intervals)
2. **Current**: Every-frame updates with smooth movement
3. **Reason**: More responsive and natural-feeling gameplay

### Input Handling
1. **Initial**: Integer pixel jumps for movement
2. **Current**: Smooth sub-pixel movement (0.8 pixels/frame)
3. **Reason**: Better feel on LED grid, less jarring

## Competition Readiness 🎯

### Strengths
- Multiple fully-playable games
- Both 1P and 2P modes
- Impressive AI coordination in Basketball
- Polished visual effects
- Runtime customization
- Sound design

### Demo Strategy
1. Show boot screen
2. Toggle between circular and square LEDs
3. Navigate menu with both transition modes
4. Play Pong 1P briefly, then 2P
5. Demonstrate Basketball AI behaviors
6. Adjust LED parameters in real-time

### Time Until Competition
~6 days (competition on January 16-17, 2026)
